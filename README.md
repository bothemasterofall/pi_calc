# Pi Calculator

This repo contains 3 programs I wrote during college to learn about
parallel computing. The 3 programs calculate pi by taking the Riemann 
sum of the following function on the interval of 0 to 1 inclusive.

`f(x) = 1/(1+x^2)`

The programs perform this operation using OMP, MPI, and a combination
of both. Each subdirectory of this repo contains a program.
